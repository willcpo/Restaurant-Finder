Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.

## Code of Conduct
### Our pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

### Our standards 

#### Examples of appropriate behavior include but are not limited to:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

#### Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### Team Norms

We are expected to meet in person at 5pm every Tuesday at Warren Weaver Hall for our standups. We also agree that teammates who do not participate can not be covered for by those who are present. 

We regard assignments as done when the code for each respective User Story is reviewed by all team members and run through the necessary unit tests before merging into the trunk. 

Sprints should take around 2 weeks for completion, although some may require up to even 4 weeks of work.

If a team member is failing to deliver on his or her obligations to the team, he or she will be contacted by the other members and expected to respond within 48 hours. Failure to do so will result in a report to the professor and a required meeting with all team members. 

The Product Backlog will be managed by the Product Owner with aid from the developers. The more valuable stories will be placed higher in the backlog and will be the main focuses of each sprint.

### Code standards

- All code must be well documented, with detailed comments defining functions and their outputs
- All code must follow standard Javascript standards. 
  - [Standard JS](https://standardjs.com/rules.html)
- To enforce standard JS, code must pass through eslint.
  - [eslint](https://github.com/standard/eslint-config-standard-react)
 
### Git standards

- Do not work on a branch for more than 3 days
- Every feature needs its own branch
- Detail pull requests with everything added, and any changes made to non-feature related code and why

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team via Slack. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
